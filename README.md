# treecraft-core
TreeCraft Core is a lightweight foundation library that automatically detects and categorizes tree blocks from any mod, providing a unified API for other mods to interact with trees.

## Building from Source

To build the project for both **Fabric** and **Forge**, run:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

This will build all modules. The resulting JAR files will be located in:

- **Fabric:** `fabric/build/libs/`
- **Forge:** `forge/build/libs/`

Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed.
