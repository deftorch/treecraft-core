# treecraft-core
TreeCraft Core is a lightweight foundation library that automatically detects and categorizes tree blocks from any mod, providing a unified API for other mods to interact with trees.

## Building from Source

To build the project, run:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

This will build all modules (`common`, `fabric`, `forge`).
Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed.
